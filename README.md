# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This project is a study guide for the coding bootcamp I'm about to take part in. I wanted to make sure I have a decent foundation for the course and to prove that I have a good enough foundation to start learning this craft. This project will help guide me for the next few months and also help solve future problems when it comes to remembering the steps of the process. I've learned how to navigate the command line much further than I ever had before and I'm really excited to use my new tools with this class.
